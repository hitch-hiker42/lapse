                    <p>For instance, read the following quote:</p><br />
                    <blockquote>"Sometimes, I can feel my bones straining under the weight of all the lives that I'm not living..."</blockquote> <br />
        <p>Like we all somehow manage to lead a well-defined life even if that ends in dissapointment or fortune. Piece by piece, filling in the gaps we are given: we live it like zombies or dummies on strings. We don't even remember what it was like in the initial years if not for those nostalgic pictures clicked by our parents and relatives; and many are even devoid of that. Do you recall your first ever memory? What it was like in the beginning, can you describe it? </p><br>
                        
        <p>Anyway, these things are primary. As you grow, your life gradually diverges more and more into a million paths and crossroads, so you cannot always have a power to make the best decisions. You cannot weigh these choices without a hindsight. Most of the time, you go with an instinct and your life is shaped on reflex.</p><br>
                        
        <p>To sum up, you don't control your strings. You cannot predict the future nor can you live all the permutations of your life and decide the best one. There's only one chance at that.</p><br>
                        
        <p>Here, you will be doing just that! Users will be given two choices at each significant point in their life and based on the decision, they will live a life as they want (or always wanted). As they grow from birth, their decisions will decide their character and they will set up a social life, a career, love, and ultimately a Book of Life as written by them.</p><br>
                        
    <p>The site will have many users writing their versions of life, and they can have a glance at others' lives as well. As every choice is rated, their lives will be judged on the basis of how they lead it and what kind of person they are becoming. So, it's like a virtual handbook or journal which lets you have the choices that life never gave you and based on the decisions of the same, it will set you up for an adventure unlike anything you've ever been in.</p><br>
