								 <h2>Lapse</h2>
        <p>We all somehow manage to lead a well-defined life even if that ends in dissapointment or fortune. Piece by piece, filling in the gaps we are given: we live it like zombies or dummies on strings. We don't even remember what it was like in the initial years if not for those nostalgic pictures clicked by our parents and relatives; and many are even devoid of that. Do you recall your first ever memory? What it was like in the beginning, can you describe it? </p><br>
                        
        <p>Anyway, these things are primary. As you grow, your life gradually diverges more and more into a million paths and crossroads, so you cannot always have a power to make the best decisions. You cannot weigh these choices without a hindsight. Most of the time, you go with an instinct and your life is shaped on reflex.</p><br>
                        
        <p>To sum up, you don't control your strings. You cannot predict the future nor can you live all the permutations of your life and decide the best one. There's only one chance at that.</p><br>
                        
        <p>Here, you will be doing just that! Users will be given two choices at each significant point in their life and based on the decision, they will live a life as they want (or always wanted). As they grow from birth, their decisions will decide their character and they will set up a social life, a career, love, and ultimately a Book of Life as written by them.</p><br>
                        
    <p>The site will have many users writing their versions of life, and they can have a glance at others' lives as well. As every choice is rated, their lives will be judged on the basis of how they lead it and what kind of person they are becoming. So, it's like a virtual handbook or journal which lets you have the choices that life never gave you and based on the decisions of the same, it will set you up for an adventure unlike anything you've ever been in.</p><br>

								<h2>The Seven Deadly Sins</h2>
								<p>“There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are detestable to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers” (Proverbs 6:16-19). 

One of our church leaders recently spoke on Acts 5:11. He mentioned how Ananias and Sapphira sold property and would give the proceeds to the church. However, they held back some of the money but said that they had given the entire proceeds. God’s judgment was immediate death. The sin of Ananias and Sapphira was not that they kept some of the profit, but that they lied to God and to the Apostles. 

Such immediate result is not the usual way God deals with us today. However, judgment and retribution for our sins are part of God’s way of running a balanced moral universe. We need to get the message across that we do not go on sinning thinking that we won’t have to reckon with God and others. 

When we receive Christ as our Lord and Savior, we know He has conquered sin in our life. It is through His death that our sins have been cleansed and no longer to be remembered. Jesus’ life makes the difference. "Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him” (Romans 4:7-8).

								<h2>The Seven Cardinal Virtues</h2>
								<p> In the early fourth century, a monk named Evagrius Ponticus came up with a list of cardinal sins—cardinal in the sense that these foundational sins lead to other sins. In AD 590, Pope Gregory revised this list to form the modern concept of the “seven deadly sins”: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and pride. These sins are well-known today through the Catholic Church and through famous writings and artwork, including Dante’s The Divine Comedy, Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and Cadmus’s The Seven Deadly Sins. Accompanying the list of the seven deadly sins is a list of seven virtues, which are seen as the inverse of the cardinal sins. Neither list, of the seven deadly sins or of the seven cardinal virtues, is explicitly biblical.

Virtues are habitual and firm dispositions to do what is morally good. The Catholic Church teaches that, by creating habits to do good and giving the best of ourselves, one can become more like God and overcome the temptation of sin. The Catholic Church focuses highly on the seven virtues as a means of combatting the seven deadly sins and thus overcoming the evil within us.

Several versions of the list of seven cardinal virtues exist. The Vatican version includes the following: prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance, faith, hope, and charity. The first four virtues are categorized as “cardinal” virtues, which means that the other virtues depend on them. The Catholic Church teaches that the cardinal virtues are acquired by education, good actions, and perseverance in struggle. The last three virtues are known as theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity. They are called “theological” virtues because they relate directly to God.

Here is a brief description of each of the seven cardinal virtues:

Prudence — The ability to find the good in every situation and choosing the right means of achieving it.

Justice — The constant and firm will to give what is due to God and neighbor.

Fortitude — The demonstration of strength in difficulties and temptations; the ability to overcome fear and other obstacles in one’s moral life.

Temperance — Balance in the use of created goods, using pleasure in moderation, and seeking that which is good.

Faith — The virtue by which one believes in God and believes that all He has said and revealed is true.

Hope — A desire for the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as one’s happiness, placing one’s trust in Christ’s promises, and relying on the grace of the Holy Spirit.

Charity — Love for God above all else for His own sake and love for one’s neighbor as oneself for the love of God.

The Vatican’s statement on charity reminds believers that all the virtues are inspired by charity, which “binds everything together in perfect harmony” (Colossians 3:14, ESV).

The Bible talks about many virtues. Biblically, virtues flow from God’s character and are produced in us through the work of the Holy Spirit. It is God’s will to conform us to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29). Once a person puts his trust in Christ, he is a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17) and he begins to reflect the fruit of the Spirit: “love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control” (Galatians 5:22–23). By God’s grace and through the work of the Holy Spirit, we become more like Christ and therefore filled with virtue. The transformation to Christlikeness is not primarily a self-help effort in which we seek to live virtuously; rather, it depends on the work of the Holy Spirit (Philippians 2:12–13). Overcoming sin and living a godly life of virtue is about abiding in Christ (John 15), yielding to and keeping in step with the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:16–18), and trusting in God and His provision for us (1 Corinthians 10:13).

Any and all sin separates us from God (Romans 6:23). Being “virtuous” is meaningless apart from a relationship with God, who alone is good (Isaiah 64:6; Luke 18:19). Our sin is only overcome through the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross. We are commanded to “make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue” (2 Peter 1:5), and the list of seven cardinal virtues might help us notice areas to work on. But we remember that true virtue comes only by the work of the Holy Spirit who indwells all who put their faith in Christ (Philippians 2:12–13). Our salvation was begun by the Holy Spirit, and the process of sanctification will be completed by Him as well (Galatians 3:3).

								<h2>Endgame</h2>
								<p>Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly
								fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of
								witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a
								case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to
								witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to
								dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one
								of the faculty.</p>

								<p>The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant
								experience of his skill. The husband of the "maid" accused her of
								flirting, and vowed revenge. The czar noticed the valet seated in the
								ante-room, looking forlorn, and asked the cause of his dejection. The
								wicked valet replied that his wife had a tooth which gave her great pain,
								keeping them both awake day and night, but would not have it drawn.</p>

								<p>"Send her to me," said the czar.</p>

								<p>The woman was brought, but persisted in affirming that her teeth were
								sound, and never ached. The valet alleged that this was always the way she
								did when the physician was called; therefore, in spite of her cries and
								remonstrances, the king ordered her husband to hold her head between his
								knees, when the czar drew out his instruments and instantly extracted the
								tooth designated by the husband, disregarding the cries of the unfortunate
								victim.</p>

								<p>In a few days the czar was informed that the thing was a put-up job by the
								jealous husband, in order to punish, if not mar the beauty of, his gallant
								wife, whereupon the instruments were again brought into requisition; and
								this time the naughty valet was the sufferer, to the extent of losing a
								sound and valuable tooth.</p>
